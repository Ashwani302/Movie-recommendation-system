# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that utilizes collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and a hybrid approach to recommend movies to users based on their interests and viewing history. The project is implemented in Python, with `main.py` as the primary script for running the recommendation engine.

## Overview

The Movie Recommendation System leverages a dataset of movie metadata and user ratings to generate personalized movie recommendations. It includes:
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on features such as genre, actors, and plot.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes user ratings and viewing history for recommendations.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both methods to improve accuracy and diversity in recommendations.

## Features

- Personalized movie recommendations based on user input.
- Sentiment analysis on user reviews to enhance recommendation logic.
- Data pre-processing for optimal model performance.

## Dataset

**Source**: [TMDB Movie Metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv)  
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16nXXdBMcQzobiwS1GW6JblWc4R59nnIL?usp=drive_link). The dataset includes:
- **Movies**: Information about movies such as title, genre, cast, and plot, stored in pickle format.
- **Similarity**: The recommendation file generated by the algorithm, based on similarity scores.

Please download and place the dataset files in the `data/` directory before running the project.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashwani302/Movie-recommendation-system.git
   cd Movie-recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the dataset** from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16nXXdBMcQzobiwS1GW6JblWc4R59nnIL?usp=drive_link) and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

1. **Run the main program**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Select the Recommendation Type**:
   - The program will prompt you to select a recommendation type ( Content-Based).
